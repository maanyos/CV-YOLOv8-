# CV-YOLOv8-
Compilation of computer vision projects  
Datasets were omitted as they are too large in size

### Autonomous navigation with drone
Well documented as I was working with another intern and there were plans to continue our work after we finished the internship  
Dataset contains an existing dataset of 1000+ images combined with ~20 more self labelled images with 100+ positive samples (multiple instances in each image)  


### Error detection with smart glasses for pilots
Not much documentation as I was the only person working on this project  
Dataset consists 210 images of our replica cockpit panel, including positive and negative samples:  
~150 train (70%), ~40 validate (20%), ~20 test (10%)  
Taking images and labelling images effort was distributed between 3 group members
