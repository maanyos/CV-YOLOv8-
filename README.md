# CV-YOLOv8-
Compilation of computer vision projects
Datasets were omitted as they are too large in size

### Autonomous navigation with drone
Well documented as I was working with another intern and there were plans to continue our work after we finished the internship
Dataset contains an existing dataset of 1000+ images combined with ~20 more self labelled images with 100+ positive samples (multiple instances in each image)


### Error detection with smart glasses for pilots
Not much documentation as I was the only person 
Dataset consists 210 images of our replica cockpit panel, including positive and negative samples
Taking image and labelling image work was distributed between 3 group members
